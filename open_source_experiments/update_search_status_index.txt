Thought:The `executeSearch()` function in the `TransportSearchAction` class is responsible for executing the search locally and for all given remote shards. It seems to handle various aspects of the search operation, including resolving indices, building alias filters, merging shard iterators, and starting the search phase. However, it doesn't appear to handle the status update of the search operation, which is the issue the user is facing. 

The user suggests that the status of the search operation should be marked as successful right away when local shards are empty because no indices match the one specified in the query. This suggests that the status update logic might be located somewhere else in the codebase, possibly in a function that `executeSearch()` calls. 

To find the exact lines causing the issue and suggest a solution, I need to look deeper into the functions called by `executeSearch()`. Specifically, I need to investigate the `searchPhaseProvider.newSearchPhase()` function, which seems to be responsible for starting the search phase.

Thought:The `newSearchPhase()` function in the `SearchPhaseProvider` class is responsible for creating a new search phase. It seems to handle various aspects of the search operation, including creating a query result consumer, and creating a search phase based on the search type. However, it doesn't appear to handle the status update of the search operation, which is the issue the user is facing. 

The user suggests that the status of the search operation should be marked as successful right away when local shards are empty because no indices match the one specified in the query. This suggests that the status update logic might be located somewhere else in the codebase, possibly in a function that `newSearchPhase()` calls. 

To find the exact lines causing the issue and suggest a solution, I need to look deeper into the functions called by `newSearchPhase()`. Specifically, I need to investigate the `SearchDfsQueryThenFetchAsyncAction` and `SearchQueryThenFetchAsyncAction` functions, which seem to be responsible for creating the search phase based on the search type.
