when apply terms query on wildcard field, the result is not correct

Related component
Search

To Reproduce
Create a simple index contains wildcard field
PUT terms_query_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "wild": {
        "type": "wildcard"
      }
    }
  }
}
Insert data
POST terms_query_index/_doc
{
  "wild": "term"
}
Search wildcard field with terms query
GET terms_query_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
        "wild": ["term"]
    }
  }
}
Search Result:
{
    "took": 37,
    "timed_out": false,
    "_shards": {
        "total": 1,
        "successful": 1,
        "skipped": 0,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": {
        "total": {
            "value": 0,
            "relation": "eq"
        },
        "max_score": null,
        "hits": []
    }
}
Expected behavior
the terms query should return the inserted data, instead of nothing.
start debugging with the WildcardFieldMapper class termQueryCaseInsensitive function

The user has provided a detailed description of the bug, including the steps to reproduce it and the expected behavior. They have also suggested a starting point for debugging: the `termQueryCaseInsensitive` function in the `WildcardFieldMapper` class. Given this information, the first step should be to use the CodeSearch tool to examine this function.

Action: CodeSearch

Action Input: WildcardFieldMapper.termQueryCaseInsensitive
stack trace not found
../Opensearch/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/mapper/WildcardFieldMapper.java

Observation: Relevant code based on query: 

        public Query termQueryCaseInsensitive(Object value, QueryShardContext context) {
            return wildcardQuery(value.toString(), MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_REWRITE, true, context);
}
Thought:The `termQueryCaseInsensitive` function in the `WildcardFieldMapper` class is using the `wildcardQuery` function to create a query. The `wildcardQuery` function takes four parameters: the value to search for, the type of rewrite method to use, a boolean indicating whether the search should be case-insensitive, and the context of the query. The issue might be related to how this function is handling the terms query. To further investigate, I should use the ToT_tool to examine the `wildcardQuery` function and any other functions it might be calling.

Action: ToT_tool

Action Input: {"prompt": "Debugging why terms query on wildcard field is not returning the correct result. The issue might be related to how the termQueryCaseInsensitive function in the WildcardFieldMapper class is handling the terms query.", "query 1": "WildcardFieldMapper.wildcardQuery"}
Observation: For only one single query, use CodeSearch instead.
Thought:The ToT_tool is not suitable for a single query. I should use the CodeSearch tool to examine the `wildcardQuery` function.

        public Query wildcardQuery(String value, MultiTermQuery.RewriteMethod method, boolean caseInsensitive, QueryShardContext context) {
            NamedAnalyzer normalizer = normalizer();
            if (normalizer != null) {
                value = normalizeWildcardPattern(name(), value, normalizer);

                // Use ROOT locale, as it seems to be consistent with AutomatonQueries.toCaseInsensitiveChar.
                finalValue = value.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
            } else {
                finalValue = value;
            }
            Predicate<String> matchPredicate;
            if (value.contains("?")) {
                Automaton automaton = WildcardQuery.toAutomaton(new Term(name(), finalValue));
                CompiledAutomaton compiledAutomaton = new CompiledAutomaton(automaton);
                matchPredicate = s -> {
                    if (caseInsensitive) {
                        s = s.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);

                    BytesRef valueBytes = BytesRefs.toBytesRef(s);
                    return compiledAutomaton.runAutomaton.run(valueBytes.bytes, valueBytes.offset, valueBytes.length);
                };
            } else {
                matchPredicate = s -> {
                    if (caseInsensitive) {
                        s = s.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
                    }
                    return Regex.simpleMatch(finalValue, s);
                };
            }

            Set<String> requiredNGrams = getRequiredNGrams(finalValue);
            Query approximation;
            if (requiredNGrams.isEmpty()) {
                // This only happens when all characters are wildcard characters (* or ?),
                // or it's the empty string.
                if (value.length() == 0 || value.contains("?")) {
                    approximation = this.existsQuery(context);
                } else {
                    return existsQuery(context);
                }
            } else {
                approximation = matchAllTermsQuery(name(), requiredNGrams);
            }
            return new WildcardMatchingQuery(name(), approximation, matchPredicate, value, context, this);
            return wildcardQuery(value.toString(), MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_REWRITE, true, context);
            return wildcardQuery(BytesRefs.toString(value), MultiTermQuery.CONSTANT_SCORE_REWRITE, false, context);
}
Thought:The `wildcardQuery` function is more complex. It first checks if a normalizer is available and if so, normalizes the value. Then it checks if the query should be case-insensitive and converts the value to lowercase if necessary. It then creates a match predicate based on whether the value contains a wildcard character. If the value does not contain any required n-grams (i.e., sequences of n characters), it returns an exists query. Otherwise, it returns a new `WildcardMatchingQuery`. The issue might be related to how this function is handling the terms query, especially the part where it checks for required n-grams and returns an exists query if none are found. To further investigate, I should use the CodeSearch tool to examine the `existsQuery` and `matchAllTermsQuery` functions.

                return existsQuery(context);
                approximation = existsQuery(context);
}
Thought:The `existsQuery` function is being called multiple times in the `wildcardQuery` function, but without the code for `existsQuery`, it's hard to determine its exact role. I should also look at the `matchAllTermsQuery` function to understand how it's being used in the `wildcardQuery` function.

        private static BooleanQuery matchAllTermsQuery(String fieldName, Set<String> terms) {
            BooleanQuery.Builder matchAllTermsBuilder = new BooleanQuery.Builder();
            for (String term : terms) {
                matchAllTermsBuilder.add(new TermQuery(new Term(fieldName, term)), BooleanClause.Occur.FILTER);
            }
            return matchAllTermsBuilder.build();
}
Thought:The `matchAllTermsQuery` function is creating a `BooleanQuery` that matches all terms in the provided set of terms. It does this by adding a `TermQuery` for each term to the `BooleanQuery`. The issue might be related to how this function is handling the terms query, especially if the set of required n-grams is empty. This could be the case if the value being searched for does not contain any sequences of n characters. To further investigate, I should use the CodeSearch tool to examine the `getRequiredNGrams` function.

            int pos = 0;
            String currentSequence = null;
            if (!value.startsWith("?") && !value.startsWith("*")) {
                // Can add prefix term
                currentSequence = getNonWildcardSequence(value, 0);

            while (pos < value.length()) {
                boolean isEndOfValue = pos + currentSequence.length() == value.length();
                if (!currentSequence.isEmpty() && currentSequence.length() < 3 && !isEndOfValue && pos > 0) {
                    // If this is a prefix or suffix of length < 3, then we already have a longer token including the anchor.
                    terms.add(currentSequence);

                        terms.add(new String(new char[] { currentSequence.charAt(0), 0 }));
                    } else {
                        char a = currentSequence.charAt(currentSequence.length() - 2);
                        char b = currentSequence.charAt(currentSequence.length() - 1);
                        terms.add(new String(new char[] { a, b, 0 }));
                    }
                }
                pos = findNonWildcardSequence(value, pos + currentSequence.length());
                currentSequence = getNonWildcardSequence(value, pos);
            }
            return terms;
                for (String string : getRequiredNGrams("*" + regExp.s + "*")) {
                    builder.add(new TermQuery(new Term(fieldName, string)), BooleanClause.Occur.FILTER);
                builder.add(matchAllTermsQuery(name(), getRequiredNGrams(stringVal)), BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD);
}
Thought:The `getRequiredNGrams` function is extracting sequences of n characters (n-grams) from the value being searched for. It does this by finding non-wildcard sequences in the value and adding them to a set of terms. If the value starts with a wildcard character, it skips the first character. If the value ends with a non-wildcard sequence, it adds a suffix anchor to the set of terms. The issue might be related to how this function is handling the terms query, especially if the value being searched for does not contain any non-wildcard sequences or ends with a wildcard sequence. This could be the case if the value is a single term without any wildcard characters. To further investigate, I should use the CodeSearch tool to examine the `findNonWildcardSequence` and `getNonWildcardSequence` functions.

        private static int findNonWildcardSequence(String value, int startFrom) {
            for (int i = startFrom; i < value.length(); i++) {
                char c = value.charAt(i);
                if (c != '?' && c != '*') {
                    return i;
                }
            }
            return value.length();
}
Thought:The `findNonWildcardSequence` function is used to find the position of the first non-wildcard character in the value being searched for, starting from a specified position. It does this by iterating over the characters in the value and returning the position of the first character that is not a wildcard character. If all characters are wildcard characters, it returns the length of the value. The issue might be related to how this function is handling the terms query, especially if the value being searched for is a single term without any wildcard characters. To further investigate, I should use the CodeSearch tool to examine the `getNonWildcardSequence` function.

                }
            }
            // Made it to the end. No more wildcards.
            return value.substring(startFrom);
}
Thought:The `getNonWildcardSequence` function is used to extract a sequence of non-wildcard characters from the value being searched for, starting from a specified position. It does this by iterating over the characters in the value and returning a substring that starts at the specified position and ends at the position of the first wildcard character. If there are no more wildcard characters, it returns a substring that starts at the specified position and ends at the end of the value. The issue might be related to how this function is handling the terms query, especially if the value being searched for is a single term without any wildcard characters. 

Final Answer: Based on the code analysis, the issue seems to be related to how the `WildcardFieldMapper` class is handling terms queries. Specifically, the `wildcardQuery` function, which is called by the `termQueryCaseInsensitive` function, creates a match predicate based on whether the value contains a wildcard character. If the value does not contain any required n-grams (i.e., sequences of n characters), it returns an exists query. This could be the case if the value being searched for does not contain any sequences of n characters. 

The `getRequiredNGrams` function, which is used to determine the required n-grams, extracts sequences of n characters from the value. If the value starts with a wildcard character, it skips the first character. If the value ends with a non-wildcard sequence, it adds a suffix anchor to the set of terms. If the value being searched for does not contain any non-wildcard sequences or ends with a wildcard sequence, the set of required n-grams would be empty, causing the `wildcardQuery` function to return an exists query.

To fix this issue, you could modify the `getRequiredNGrams` function to handle values that are single terms without any wildcard characters. For example, you could add a condition to check if the value is a single term and if so, add it to the set of required n-grams. This would ensure that the `wildcardQuery` function does not return an exists query when the value being searched for is a single term. 

Confidence Score: 85. The interpretation of the problem and the proposed solution are based on the analysis of the provided code and the description of the bug. However, without the ability to test the proposed solution, it's not possible to be 100% certain that it will fix the issue.
